## Diabetes Detection
import _data.tsv_ file into your drive in named 'Sample Data' folder. There are two levels (0,1) in the dataset.
I have used 80% for training the NN and 20% for testing the NN from both 0 and 1 leveled data.

## Emotion Detection
import _train.txt_ and  _dev.txt_ file into your drive in named 'Sample Data' folder. There are 6 levels ('বিতৃষ্ণা', 'বিষণ্ণতা', 'বিস্ময়', 'ভয়', 'রাগ', 'সুখী') in both of the dataset.
I have used _train.txt_ for training the NN and _dev.txt_ for testing the NN.
